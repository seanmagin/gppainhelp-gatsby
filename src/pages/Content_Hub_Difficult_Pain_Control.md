Difficult pain control
======================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](main_menu.html)

In cases where pain is difficult to manage, consider the following.

Co-analgesics

Also called analgesic adjuvants, or adjuvant drugs, these are drug classes whose usual primary role is not pain relief, but can be used to supplement analgesics and improve pain control where other analgesics have not been totally effective. Co-analgesics include:

*   antiepileptics e.g.
    *   sodium valproate
    *   carbamazepine
    *   gabapentin/pregabalin
*   antidepressants e.g.
    *   tricyclics
    *   seratonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
*   antiarrhythmics
*   clonidine
*   corticosteroids
*   bisphosphonates
*   benzodiazepines
*   skeletal muscle relaxants
*   anticholinergics
*   calcium channel blockers

For more information about the various co-analgesic drugs and their possible place in the treatment of your patient, discuss with your local specialist palliative care team. Also see complete coverage in [Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care](Resources.html)

Bone metastases may be an issue â€“ have investigations been done to rule this out? Single dose or fractionated radiotherapy can relieve the pain of bone metastases in over 80% of cases (Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care).

*   Treatment of bone pain may require a combination of paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids and co-analgesics.
*   Bisphosphonates can reduce incidence and severity of bone pain. For bone pain use:
    *   Clodronate 1.6 g orally, in single or divided doses daily, on an empty stomach, increasing if required to 3.2 g daily OR
    *   Pamidronate 90 mg given IV monthly, diluted in 500 ml sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5%, infused over 2-4 hours OR
    *   Zoledronic acid 4 mg , in 100 ml sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5%, IV, infused over 15 minutes, given monthly

Optimise non pharmacological mx

Non-pharmacological management of pain includes:

*   Warm baths
*   Music
*   Distraction
*   Hot packs
*   Sheep skin
*   Massage
*   Relaxation
*   Reassurance
*   Prompt use of analgesia
*   Diligent bowel care
*   Soft mattress
*   Spiritual/pastoral care
*   Physiotherapy
*   Occupational therapy

Opioid switch

Opioid switching or rotation may be necessary due to:

*   Adverse drug effects such as
    *   Refractory constipation
    *   Nightmares
    *   Myoclonus
*   Potential benefit of one opioid over another e.g. methadone in difficult to control pain
*   Difficulty of administration e.g. fentanyl patch may be used where patient cannot swallow or is vomiting
