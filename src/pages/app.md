Introduction
------------

Welcome to the GP Pain Help App, to help GPs manage cancer pain in their patients. Data generated by use of this app may be used in de-identified form for research by the Centre for Palliative Care Research and Education. Please click the box below to indicate you agree to participate in this research which potentially will improve the care of your patients with cancer pain.

General principles
------------------

Opioids are the only pharmacological class of drug with the ability to control severe pain

Use oral route first line where possible

Dose regularly with controlled-release (CR) preparations, with as required (prn) immediate-release (IR) doses (1/6 daily dose) to assess analgesic requirements

Titrate dose against effect and [toxicity](#contenthub-opioid) – consider switching to another class of opioid if [toxicity](#contenthub-opioid) becomes dose-limiting

Assessment
----------

Pain should be assessed by:

*   Taking a history
*   Performing a physical examination
*   Identifying other factors that may influence the pain experience
*   Regular review

Mild to Moderate Pain
=====================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Treatment of mild to moderate pain
----------------------------------

Mild to moderate pain is most commonly controlled by paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Paracetamol dose: 500-1000mg every 4-6 hours to a maximum of 4 g daily.

NSAIDs: appropriate for mild to moderate pain related to inflammation, tissue injury, and metastatic bone pain (Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010).

Adverse effects of NSAIDs:

*   Gastrointestinal toxicity
*   Cardiovascular toxicity
    
    (Source: Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010).
    
    Patients taking NSAIDs should have their cardiovascular risks closely monitored and actively managed. See [Therapeutic Guidelines: Cardiovascular](http://www.tg.org.au/index.php?sectionid=42) for further information.
    
    Patients needing low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection should continue to take it even if needing NSAIDs; they should be monitored for GI adverse effects.
    
    Separation in time of dose is advised where NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may interfere with effect of low doseaspirin on platelets.
    
*   Renal toxicity
    
    (Source: Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010).
    
    All NSAIDs can cause renal impairment. Renal toxicity is no less with COX-2-selective inhibitors.

First line treatment
====================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

First line treatment:

1.  Opioid
2.  Plus co-analgesic/adjuvant drug where neuropathic pain involved

Opioids

Source: Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010

Opioid analgesics are used to treat moderate to severe pain; they diminish both the sensation and affective response to pain. NB: "Safe use requires knowledge of available opioids, their relative indications, formulations and routes of administration, and awareness of potential adverse effects and how to manage these" (Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care, 2010, p. 100).

Opioid preparations may be available as:

*   immediate release
*   modified release
*   a combination of both

Modified release preparations should never be crushed or chewed as this can result in a large dose being absorbed over a short period.

See the [Dose Conversion](#dose) tables for converting from other opioids to an equianalgesic dose of oral morphine, or converting from oral morphine to equianalgesic doses of other opioids.

Antiepileptic drugs (Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010):

sodium valproate 200 mg orally, once or twice daily, increasing as tolerated according to patient response every 2 days to maximum of 1500 mg daily in divided doses

OR

gabapentin (consult palliative care team) ... OR  
pregabalin (consult palliative care team) ... OR  
carbamazepine (consult palliative care team) ... OR  
clonazepam 0.5 mg orally/subcutaneously/sublingually, twice daily, increasing to maximum of 2 mg twice daily

Antidepressant drugs

amitriptyline 10-25 mg orally, at night, increasing every 7 days to a usual maximum dose of 75 mg at night OR

nortriptyline 10-25 mg orally, at night, increasing every 7 days to a usual maximum dose of 75 mg at night

For specific suggestions regarding starting doses of co-analgesics, contact your local palliative care team.

Neuropathic pain:

Patients experiencing pain related to cancer may have an element of neuropathic pain, which responds only partially to opioids. The use of co-analgesics may be required e.g. antiepileptic drugs or antidepressant drugs.

Determining whether pain is neuropathic

Does the patient describe their pain in this way?

*   Pins and needles, tingling, burning, lancinating, shooting
*   Allodynia
*   Pain in missing body part
*   Pain in a numb area

Any or all of these symptoms suggest neuropathic pain related to nerve involvement. Because neuropathic pain responds only partially to opioids, the use of co-analgesic or adjuvant drugs may be necessary.

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#mod-severe)

Second line treatment
=====================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Where pain is not adequately controlled, consider the following:

How many breakthrough (BT) doses has the patient required in the last 24 hours? If more than 2-3 doses in 24 hours, the regular daily dose of opioid may need to be adjusted by adding the total BT doses per 24 hours to the daily dose, up to a 50% increase in the daily dose.

NB: Increase the dose in this way no more often than every 2-3 days.

If not already treating for neuropathic pain, consider whether that might be an issue

Gradually increase the dose of the co-analgesic drug/s according to recommendations for antiepileptics or antidepressants.

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#mod-severe)

Some types of pain
==================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Nociceptive superficial somatic pain

If the patient describes their pain as:

*   sharp
*   stinging
*   hot

think nociceptive superficial somatic pain e.g. from malignant ulcers or stomatitis use [opioids](#firstline)

Nociceptive deep somatic pain

Described as dull, throbbing, aching

May relate to:

*   liver capsule distension – use corticosteroids
*   [bone metastases](#contenthub-difficultcontrol)

Visceral nociceptive pain

Does the patient describe their pain as:

*   cramping or colicky
*   dull, referred pain

Symptoms indicate visceral nociceptive pain. Use:

*   opioids, plus
    *   antispasmodics if colicky pain
    *   paracetamol, corticosteroids if constant pain

Skeletal muscle spasm pain

Use:

*   diazepam 2-5 mg orally up to three times daily
*   baclofen 5 mg orally, 3 times daily, increasing every 3 days to 10-25 mg orally, 3 times daily

Smooth muscle spasm pain

Hyoscine hydrobromide or hyoscine butylbromide may be used with opioids for cramping pain related to bowel obstruction. Use:

hyoscine hydrobromide

*   0.4 mg SC, 4-hourly or
*   up to 1.6 mg/24 hours via continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI)

OR

hyoscine butylbromide

*   10-20 mg SC, 4 hourly or
*   60-80 mg/24 hours initially by CSCI; titrate to effect to maximum of 120 mg/24 hours

I'm not sure

If you have any concerns at all about your patient's pain or other symptom management, contact their specialist palliative care team.

Or see [Trouble Shooting](#troubleshooting) for contact details for Queensland specialist palliative care teams.

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#treatment-intro)

Breakthrough Pain
=================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Breakthrough pain occurs between regular doses of analgesia; it reflects an increase in pain level beyond the control of the baseline analgesic.

In this situation the patient should be given an additional, or breakthrough, dose of their regular opioid.

The breakthrough (BT) dose ordered should be one-twelfth to one-sixth of the total daily dose (50% to 100% of the regular 4-hourly dose). The patient should be instructed to take the BT dose as often as necessary to control the pain. BT doses should be given no more frequently than every 30 minutes.

The regular analgesic dose should be reviewed if BT pain is not controlled after 3 doses.

The regular dose of opioid should be taken at the scheduled time.

Opioids
=======

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

[

Classification

](#contenthub-opioid)

Opiates are naturally occurring compounds derived from the juice of the opium poppy (codeine, morphine, papaveretum)

Opioids refer to both naturally-occurring and synthetic drugs that have morphine-like activity

Opioids can be used for mild to moderate pain (e.g. codeine, dihydrocodeine)

Opioids are recommended for moderate to severe pain (e.g. morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydromorphone, buprenorphine, methadone)

[

Side effects

](#contenthub-opioid)

All opioids have a similar side-effect profile:

*   Sedation, for the first few days after initiation, then with excessive dosing/overdose
*   Nausea and vomiting; often subsides after few days, but can be persistent requiring aggressive treatment
*   Constipation; almost universal, prophylactic laxatives essential when patient started on opioid
*   Bad dreams

[

Signs of excessive dosing/toxicity

](#contenthub-opioid)

*   Drowsiness, difficulty rousing
*   Myoclonic jerks, may need treatment with benzodiazepines
*   Respiratory depression; if respiratory rate <8/min and/or depressed oxygen saturations then can be reversed with naloxone (dilute 400mcg vial in 10ml N/Saline and deliver slowly in amounts of 0.5-1ml every 2-3 minutes)
*   Hallucinations; consider opioid switch
*   Itch; common in children, rare in adults. Can switch to opioid of different class

[

Pain related to tumour oedema

](#contenthub-opioid)

Corticosteroids will temporarily reduce tumour related oedema. Use:

*   Dexamethasone 4-8 mg orally or SC, daily in the morning OR
*   Prednisolone 25-100 mg orally, daily in the morning

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

Choice of opioid
================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

There is no evidence that any one opioid is significantly more efficacious or less toxic than any other at an equianalgesic dose. The choice of opioid depends on a number of factors:

Ability to swallow: oral route is preferred; if unable to swallow or compromised GI tract consider transdermal (e.g. fentanyl patch, buprenorphine patch) or parenteral route (see below)

Impaired renal function: avoid morphine (can be used at lower doses, less frequently), caution with oxycodone or hydromorphone. Recommended opioids are fentanyl, buprenorphine or methadone

Impaired liver function: caution with oxycodone

Allergies/intolerance:rare, often reflect previous adverse event (e.g. nausea and vomiting following post-op opioids). If true allergy, rotate to opioid of different class (see classification)

Constipation/ileus/bowel obstruction: slowing of bowel transit time is a common feature of all opioids. Lipophilic opioids (fentanyl, buprenorphine) may be less constipating. Consider combination preparation of oxycodone and naloxone (Targin©), or parenteral formulations

Age: morphine tends to be poorly tolerated in the elderly (probably as a reflection of impaired renal function). Buprenorphine patches (Norspan©) give a continuous infusion of low-dose opioid.

Cognitive function: consider once daily formulations or tablets/capsules that can be delivered in Webster packs where cognitive function impaired

Compliance: consider transdermal preparations for improved compliance

Cost: not all opioids are subsidised by the PBS

Availability: some countries impose strict limitations on availability of opioids

Experience: use a limited number of opioids and become familiar with their use; patients with difficult pain should be referred to palliative care or pain specialists

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

Route of delivery
=================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Oral: preferred route of opioid delivery; as effective as parenteral opioid at equianalgesic doses

Parenteral: if oral route not possible (e.g. head and neck tumour, bowel obstruction, nausea/vomiting)one or more of the following routes may be appropriate

Subcutaneous: most opioids can be delivered by this route as a continuous infusion or by bolus dosing; methadone can be a skin irritant and must be diluted

Intramuscular: there is little logic for using this route as opioids are well absorbed subcutaneously

Intravenous: route of choice in the USA, dose is equivalent to subcutaneous dose

Transdermal: several opioids are available in patch formulations that are well absorbed through the skin (e.g. fentanyl {Durogesic ©}, buprenorphine {Norspan ©})

Other: transmucosal (fentanyl lozenge{Actiq ©}, buccal tablets), rectal suppositories, intranasal spray, sublingual drops

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

How to initiate an opioid
=========================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

In patients with no hepatic or renal dysfunction, a total daily dose of 20–30 mg oral morphine equivalent is a reasonable starting point.

Dosing

*   Start with low dose immediate release preparation given every 4 hours
*   Convert to controlled release (CR) preparation when dose requirement known after 2-3 days
*   Continue to provide as required (prn) dose equivalent to 4 hourly dose
*   Prescribe prophylactic laxatives

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

Difficult pain control
======================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

In cases where pain is difficult to manage, consider the following.

Co-analgesics

Also called analgesic adjuvants, or adjuvant drugs, these are drug classes whose usual primary role is not pain relief, but can be used to supplement analgesics and improve pain control where other analgesics have not been totally effective. Co-analgesics include:

*   antiepileptics e.g.
    *   sodium valproate
    *   carbamazepine
    *   gabapentin/pregabalin
*   antidepressants e.g.
    *   tricyclics
    *   seratonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
*   antiarrhythmics
*   clonidine
*   corticosteroids
*   bisphosphonates
*   benzodiazepines
*   skeletal muscle relaxants
*   anticholinergics
*   calcium channel blockers

For more information about the various co-analgesic drugs and their possible place in the treatment of your patient, discuss with your local specialist palliative care team. Also see complete coverage in [Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care](#resources)

Bone metastases may be an issue © have investigations been done to rule this out? Single dose or fractionated radiotherapy can relieve the pain of bone metastases in over 80% of cases (Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care).

*   Treatment of bone pain may require a combination of paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids and co-analgesics.
*   Bisphosphonates can reduce incidence and severity of bone pain. For bone pain use:
    *   Clodronate 1.6 g orally, in single or divided doses daily, on an empty stomach, increasing if required to 3.2 g daily OR
    *   Pamidronate 90 mg given IV monthly, diluted in 500 ml sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5%, infused over 2-4 hours OR
    *   Zoledronic acid 4 mg , in 100 ml sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5%, IV, infused over 15 minutes, given monthly

Optimise non pharmacological mx

Non-pharmacological management of pain includes:

*   Warm baths
*   Music
*   Distraction
*   Hot packs
*   Sheep skin
*   Massage
*   Relaxation
*   Reassurance
*   Prompt use of analgesia
*   Diligent bowel care
*   Soft mattress
*   Spiritual/pastoral care
*   Physiotherapy
*   Occupational therapy

Opioid switch

Opioid switching or rotation may be necessary due to:

*   Adverse drug effects such as
    *   Refractory constipation
    *   Nightmares
    *   Myoclonus
*   Potential benefit of one opioid over another e.g. methadone in difficult to control pain
*   Difficulty of administration e.g. fentanyl patch may be used where patient cannot swallow or is vomiting

(Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care)

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

Opioids in special populations
==============================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Renal Impairment: impaired renal function avoid morphine (can be used at lower doses, less frequently), caution with oxycodone or hydromorphone. Recommended opioids are fentanyl, buprenorphine or methadone

Hepatic Impairment: caution with oxycodone

Elderly: morphine tends to be poorly tolerated in the elderly (probably as a reflection of impaired renal function). Buprenorphine patches(Norspan©) give a continuous infusion of low-dose opioid

Possible effects/characteristics:

*   Confusion
*   Increased plasma free drug concentration related to reduced metabolism and distribution volume in the elderly
*   Reduced clearance of opioids related to reduced hepatic blood flow (up to 40-50% by age 75).

Children: Contact the paediatric palliative care team at Royal Children’s Hospital [07 3646 1357](tel:+61736461357)

Opioid Dependence: Patients with a history of abuse of opioid analgesics should not be denied opioid analgesics for management of pain. Their care may need to involve a health professional with expertise in addiction therapy.

Such patients may require higher than usual opioid doses to control pain (Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care).

See Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care, 'Managing Pain in Patients with Substance Use Disorders', pp 226-7.

Terminally Ill: Although patients may be unable to respond when close to death, there is no evidence to suggest sensation is reduced at this time. There should be no reduction in analgesia unless a judgment is made by a palliative care clinician that the patient is over-sedated or narcotised.

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

Opioids to avoid
================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Dextropropoxyphene, available in combination formulations usually with paracetamol (e.g. Digesic), no more effective than codeine, significant toxicity

Pethidine, no advantage over other opioids, cumulative toxicity, toxic metabolites, no oral formulation, dependency issues, no advantage in colic pain

[![back](images/backarrow.png)](#content-hub)

Morphine myths and facts
========================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Fact: Morphine should be titrated according to efficacy and toxicity.

Myth: Morphine or other opioids hasten death.  
Fact: Morphine does not hasten death if used correctly, and in fact appropriate analgesia can increase life expectancy (Temel et al., 2010).

Myth: Morphine is only used when death is imminent.  
Fact: Morphine should be used when a person’s pain is severe enough to warrant it; use does not imply that death is imminent

Myth: There is a limit to the dose of morphine that can be used.  
Fact: Morphine has no upper limit dose, though in practice if increasingly higher doses are required, consideration should be given to opioid switching.

Myth: Use of morphine will interfere with what other treatment options may be used.  
Fact: Morphine use will not limit other treatment options.

Myth: Morphine has intolerable side effects.  
Fact: Morphine rarely has intolerable side effects if titrated correctly.

Myth: A person taking morphine should not be driving a car.  
Fact: Taking morphine does not exclude a person from driving if the dose is stable.

Breakthrough Pain
=================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Breakthrough pain occurs between regular doses of analgesia; it reflects an increase in pain level beyond the control of the baseline analgesic.

In this situation the patient should be given an additional, or breakthrough, dose of their regular opioid.

The breakthrough (BT) dose ordered should be one-twelfth to one-sixth of the total daily dose (50% to 100% of the regular 4-hourly dose). The patient should be instructed to take the BT dose as often as necessary to control the pain. BT doses should be given no more frequently than every 30 minutes.

The regular analgesic dose should be reviewed if BT pain is not controlled after 3 doses.

The regular dose of opioid should be taken at the scheduled time.

Incident Pain
=============

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Incident pain is exacerbated by, or occurs with, activity, such as getting out of bed. It is common in patients with metastatic bone disease.

Consideration should be given to palliative radiotherapy, and where relevant, orthopaedic surgery to pre-empt or stabilise a fracture.

Options for management of incident pain

*   Adequate doses of an NSAID
*   Modification of frequency/type of dressing if the cause of incident pain
*   Short acting opioid such as fentanyl
*   Other short acting agents e.g. nitrous oxide
*   Seek input of a physiotherapist or occupational therapist to help minimise pain

Some types of pain
==================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

Nociceptive superficial somatic pain

If the patient describes their pain as:

*   sharp
*   stinging
*   hot

think nociceptive superficial somatic pain e.g. from malignant ulcers or stomatitis use [opioids](#firstline)

Nociceptive deep somatic pain

Described as dull, throbbing, aching

May relate to:

*   liver capsule distension – use corticosteroids
*   [bone metastases](#contenthub-difficultcontrol)

Visceral nociceptive pain

Does the patient describe their pain as:

*   cramping or colicky
*   dull, referred pain

Symptoms indicate visceral nociceptive pain. Use:

*   opioids, plus
    *   antispasmodics if colicky pain
    *   paracetamol, corticosteroids if constant pain

Skeletal muscle spasm pain

Use:

*   diazepam 2-5 mg orally up to three times daily
*   baclofen 5 mg orally, 3 times daily, increasing every 3 days to 10-25 mg orally, 3 times daily

Smooth muscle spasm pain

Hyoscine hydrobromide or hyoscine butylbromide may be used with opioids for cramping pain related to bowel obstruction. Use:

hyoscine hydrobromide

*   0.4 mg SC, 4-hourly or
*   up to 1.6 mg/24 hours via continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI)

OR

hyoscine butylbromide

*   10-20 mg SC, 4 hourly or
*   60-80 mg/24 hours initially by CSCI; titrate to effect to maximum of 120 mg/24 hours

Patient FAQs
============

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](#home)

[

Q1: If I start taking morphine now, doesn't that mean there'll be nothing to control my pain at the end?

](#faq)

A: No, it's important to get your pain controlled so your quality of life is improved. The morphine dose can be increased if necessary, and there are many other similar drugs that can be tried if morphine no longer controls your pain adequately.

[

Q2: I've had morphine before and it made me sick; doesn't that mean I'm allergic to it?

](#faq)

A: No, it's common for people to experience nausea and vomiting when first taking drugs such as morphine. You can be given a small dose of a medication to help control that (e.g. metoclopramide 10mg oral tds) and it should settle within a week.

[

Q3: I don't want to take morphine in case I get addicted to it.

](#faq)

A: Research has confirmed what most doctors and nurses know already – that use of strong medications such as morphine for pain control does not lead to addiction (psychological dependence).

Formulations see PBS A-Z Medicine Listing ([www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing](http://www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing))\*

[

Q4: My pain isn't properly controlled by my medication; should I try another one?

](#faq)

A: You should speak with your GP or specialist palliative care team member. You may have >[incident pain](#contenthub-incident) or [breakthrough pain](#breakthrough), which should be able to be controlled.

Glossary/Index

Glossary

Allodynia is pain in response to a stimulus that would not normally cause pain e.g. light brushing of the skin.

Breakthrough pain Breakthrough pain occurs between regular doses of analgesia; it reflects an increase in pain level beyond the control of the baseline analgesic. [Suggestions](#breakthrough) for managing breakthrough pain.

Incident pain is exacerbated by, or occurs with, activity, such as getting out of bed. It is common in patients with metastatic bone disease. See [suggestions](#contenthub-incident) for managing incident pain.

Neuropathic pain arises from nerves directly invaded by cancer, or damaged e.g. by diabetic neuropathy or chemotherapy. A patient with neuropathic pain may describe it as like pins and needles, tingling, burning, or shooting. Neuropathic pain may also manifest as pain in a missing body part, or in a numb area.

Nociceptive pain is associated with tissue distortion or injury (twycross, wilcock and toller, 2009).

Tolerance is a normal physiological response to chronic opioid therapy where increasing doses are required to produce the same effect (Woodruff, 2004).
