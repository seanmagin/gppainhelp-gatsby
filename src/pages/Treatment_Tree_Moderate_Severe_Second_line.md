Second line treatment
=====================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](main_menu.html)

Where pain is not adequately controlled, consider the following:

How many breakthrough (BT) doses has the patient required in the last 24 hours? If more than 2-3 doses in 24 hours, the regular daily dose of opioid may need to be adjusted by adding the total BT doses per 24 hours to the daily dose, up to a 50% increase in the daily dose.

NB: Increase the dose in this way no more often than every 2-3 days.

If not already treating for neuropathic pain, consider whether that might be an issue.

Gradually increase the dose of the co-analgesic drug/s according to recommendations for antiepileptics or antidepressants.
