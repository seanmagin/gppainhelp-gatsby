Classification

Opiates are naturally occurring compounds derived from the juice of the opium poppy (codeine, morphine, papaveretum)

Opioids refer to both naturally-occurring and synthetic drugs that have morphine-like activity

Opioids can be used for mild to moderate pain (e.g. codeine, dihydrocodeine)

Opioids are recommended for moderate to severe pain (e.g. morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydromorphone, buprenorphine, methadone)

Side effects

All opioids have a similar side-effect profile:

*   Sedation, for the first few days after initiation, then with excessive dosing/overdose
*   Nausea and vomiting; often subsides after few days, but can be persistent requiring aggressive treatment
*   Constipation; almost universal, prophylactic laxatives essential when patient started on opioid
*   Bad dreams

Signs of excessive dosing/toxicity

*   Drowsiness, difficulty rousing
*   Myoclonic jerks, may need treatment with benzodiazepines
*   Respiratory depression; if respiratory rate <8/min and/or depressed oxygen saturations then can be reversed with naloxone (dilute 400mcg vial in 10ml N/Saline and deliver slowly in amounts of 0.5-1ml every 2-3 minutes)
*   Hallucinations; consider opioid switch
*   Itch; common in children, rare in adults. Can switch to opioid of different class

Pain related to tumour oedema

Corticosteroids will temporarily reduce tumour related oedema. Use:

*   Dexamethasone 4-8 mg orally or SC, daily in the morning OR
*   Prednisolone 25-100 mg orally, daily in the morning
