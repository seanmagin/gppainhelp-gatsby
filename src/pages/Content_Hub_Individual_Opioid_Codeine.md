Analgesic for mild to moderate pain.

Relatively weak analgesic, often used in combination with non-opioids e.g. paracetamol.

Formulations: see PBS A-Z Medicine Listing ([www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing](http://www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing))\*

Codeine phosphate

*   Tablet 30mg

Benefits:

*   Useful for mild to moderate pain,
*   Important role as anti-tussive and antidiarrhoeal agent

Limitations:

*   A subset of the population is unable to metabolise codeine to its active metabolite (morphine) and therefore derive no analgesic benefit from the drug

Dose conversion : morphine to codeine conversion = 1:10
