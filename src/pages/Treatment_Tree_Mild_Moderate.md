Treatment of mild to moderate pain
----------------------------------

Mild to moderate pain is most commonly controlled by paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Paracetamol dose: 500-1000mg every 4-6 hours to a maximum of 4 g daily.

NSAIDs: appropriate for mild to moderate pain related to inflammation, tissue injury, and metastatic bone pain (Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010).

Adverse effects of NSAIDs:

*   Gastrointestinal toxicity
*   Cardiovascular toxicity
    
    (Source: Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010).
    
    Patients taking NSAIDs should have their cardiovascular risks closely monitored and actively managed. See [Therapeutic Guidelines: Cardiovascular](http://www.tg.org.au/index.php?sectionid=42) for further information.
    
    Patients needing low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection should continue to take it even if needing NSAIDs; they should be monitored for GI adverse effects.
    
    Separation in time of dose is advised where NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may interfere with effect of low dose aspirin on platelets.
    
*   Renal toxicity
    
    (Source: Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010).
    
    All NSAIDs can cause renal impairment. Renal toxicity is no less with COX-2-selective inhibitors.
