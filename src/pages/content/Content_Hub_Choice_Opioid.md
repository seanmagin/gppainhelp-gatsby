Choice of opioid
================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](main_menu.html)

There is no evidence that any one opioid is significantly more efficacious or less toxic than any other at an equianalgesic dose. The choice of opioid depends on a number of factors:

Ability to swallow: oral route is preferred; if unable to swallow or compromised GI tract consider transdermal (e.g. fentanyl patch, buprenorphine patch) or parenteral route (most commonly subcutaneous).

Impaired renal function: avoid morphine (can be used at lower doses, less frequently), caution with oxycodone or hydromorphone. Recommended opioids are fentanyl, buprenorphine or methadone.

Impaired liver function: caution with oxycodone.

Allergies/intolerance: rare, often reflect previous adverse event (e.g. nausea and vomiting following post-op opioids). If true allergy, rotate to opioid of different class (see classification).

Constipation/ileus/bowel obstruction: slowing of bowel transit time is a common feature of all opioids. Lipophilic opioids (fentanyl, buprenorphine) may be less constipating. Consider combination preparation of oxycodone and naloxone (Targin©), or parenteral formulations.

Age: morphine tends to be poorly tolerated in the elderly (probably as a reflection of impaired renal function). Buprenorphine patches (Norspan©) give a continuous infusion of low-dose opioid.

Cognitive function: consider once daily formulations or tablets/capsules that can be delivered in Webster packs where cognitive function impaired.

Compliance: consider transdermal preparations for improved compliance.

Cost: not all opioids are subsidised by the PBS.

Availability: some countries impose strict limitations on availability of opioids.

Experience: use a limited number of opioids and become familiar with their use; patients with difficult pain should be referred to palliative care or pain specialists.
