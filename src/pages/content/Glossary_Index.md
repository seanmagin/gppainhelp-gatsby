Allodynia is pain in response to a stimulus that would not normally cause pain e.g. light brushing of the skin.

Breakthrough pain occurs between regular doses of analgesia; it reflects an increase in pain level beyond the control of the baseline analgesic. [Suggestions](Breakthrough_Pain.html) for managing breakthrough pain.

Hyperalgesia is increased sensitivity to a painful stimulus.

Incident pain is exacerbated by, or occurs with, activity, such as getting out of bed. It is common in patients with metastatic bone disease. See [suggestions](Content_Hub_Incident_Pain.html) for managing incident pain.

Neuropathic pain arises from nerves directly invaded by cancer, or damaged e.g. by diabetic neuropathy or chemotherapy. A patient with neuropathic pain may describe it as like pins and needles, tingling, burning, or shooting. Neuropathic pain may also manifest as pain in a missing body part, or in a numb area.

Nociceptive pain is associated with tissue distortion or injury (Twycross, Wilcock and Toller, 2009).

Tolerance is a normal physiological response to chronic opioid therapy where increasing doses are required to produce the same effect (Woodruff, 2004).
