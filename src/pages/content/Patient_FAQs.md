Q1: If I start taking morphine now, doesn't that mean there'll be nothing to control my pain at the end?

A: No, it's important to get your pain controlled so your quality of life is improved. The morphine dose can be increased if necessary, and there are many other similar drugs that can be tried if morphine no longer controls your pain adequately.

Q2: I've had morphine before and it made me sick; doesn't that mean I'm allergic to it?

A: No, it's common for people to experience nausea and vomiting when first taking drugs such as morphine. You can be given a small dose of a medication to help control that (e.g. metoclopramide 10mg oral tds) and it should settle within a week.

Q3: I don't want to take morphine in case I get addicted to it.

A: Research has confirmed what most doctors and nurses know already â€“ that use of strong medications such as morphine for pain control does not lead to addiction (psychological dependence).

Q4: My pain isn't properly controlled by my medication; should I try another one?

A: You should speak with your GP or specialist palliative care team member. You may have [incident pain](Content_Hub_Incident_Pain.html) or [breakthrough pain](Breakthrough_Pain.html), which should be able to be controlled.
