First line treatment
====================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](main_menu.html)

First line treatment:

1.  Opioid
2.  Plus co-analgesic/adjuvant drug where neuropathic pain involved

Opioids

Opioid analgesics are used to treat moderate to severe pain; they diminish both the sensation and affective response to pain. NB: "Safe use requires knowledge of available opioids, their relative indications, formulations and routes of administration, and awareness of potential adverse effects and how to manage these." (Therapeutic Guidelines: Palliative Care, 2010, p. 100).

Opioid preparations may be available as:

*   immediate release
*   modified release
*   a combination of both

Modified release preparations should never be crushed or chewed as this can result in a large dose being absorbed over a short period.

See the [Dose Conversion](Dose_Conversion.html) tables for converting from other opioids to an equianalgesic dose of oral morphine, or converting from oral morphine to equianalgesic doses of other opioids.

Antiepileptic drugs (Therapeutic Guidelines, 2010):

sodium valproate 200 mg orally, once or twice daily, increasing as tolerated according to patient response every 2 days to maximum of 1500 mg daily in divided doses

OR

gabapentin (consult palliative care team) ... OR  
pregabalin (consult palliative care team) ... OR  
carbamazepine (consult palliative care team) ... OR  
clonazepam 0.5 mg orally/subcutaneously/sublingually, twice daily, increasing to maximum of 2 mg twice daily

Antidepressant drugs

amitriptyline 10-25 mg orally, at night, increasing every 7 days to a usual maximum dose of 75 mg at night OR

nortriptyline 10-25 mg orally, at night, increasing every 7 days to a usual maximum dose of 75 mg at night

For specific suggestions regarding starting doses of co-analgesics, contact your local palliative care team.

Neuropathic pain:

Patients experiencing pain related to cancer may have an element of neuropathic pain, which responds only partially to opioids. The use of co-analgesics may be required e.g. antiepileptic drugs or antidepressant drugs.

Determining whether pain is neuropathic

Does the patient describe their pain in this way?

*   Pins and needles, tingling, burning, lancinating, shooting
*   [Allodynia](Glossary_Index.html)
*   Pain in missing body part
*   Pain in a numb area

Any or all of these symptoms suggest neuropathic pain related to nerve involvement. Because neuropathic pain responds only partially to opioids, the use of co-analgesic or adjuvant drugs may be necessary.
