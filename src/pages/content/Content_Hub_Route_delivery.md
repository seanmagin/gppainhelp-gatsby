Route of delivery
=================

[![home](images/homebtn.png)](main_menu.html)

Oral: preferred route of opioid delivery; as effective as parenteral opioid at equianalgesic doses.

Parenteral: if oral route not possible (e.g. head and neck tumour, bowel obstruction, nausea/vomiting) one or more of the following routes may be appropriate.

Subcutaneous: most opioids can be delivered by this route as a continuous infusion or by bolus dosing; methadone can be a skin irritant and must be diluted.

Intramuscular: there is little logic for using this route as opioids are well absorbed subcutaneously.

Intravenous: route of choice in the USA, dose is equivalent to subcutaneous dose.

Transdermal: several opioids are available in patch formulations that are well absorbed through the skin (e.g. fentanyl {Durogesic ©}, buprenorphine {Norspan ©}).

Other: transmucosal (fentanyl lozenge {Actiq ©}, buccal tablets), rectal suppositories, intranasal spray, sublingual drops.
