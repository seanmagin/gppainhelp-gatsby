The morphine dose can be increased if necessary, and there are many other similar drugs that can be tried if morphine no longer controls your pain adequately.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Q2: I’ve had morphine before and it made me sick; doesn’t that mean I’m allergic to it?</p>\n<p>A: No, it’s common for people to experience nausea and vomiting when first taking drugs such as morphine. You can be given a small dose of a medication to help control that (e.g. metoclopramide 10mg oral tds) and it should settle within a week.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Q3: I don’t want to take morphine in case I get addicted to it.</p>\n<p>A: Research has confirmed what most doctors and nurses know already – that use of strong medications such as morphine for pain control does not lead to addiction (psychological dependence).</p>\n<p>Formulations see PBS A-Z Medicine Listing (<a href=\"http://www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing\">www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing</a>)*</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Q4: My pain isn’t properly controlled by my medication; should I try another one?</p>\n<p>A: You should speak with your GP or specialist palliative care team member. You may have <a href=\"Content_Hub_Incident_Pain.html\">incident pain</a> or <a href=\"Breakthrough_Pain.html\">breakthrough pain</a>, which should be able to be controlled.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/banner-long-footer-whitetext.png\" alt=\"cpcre\"> <img src=\"images/acrrm.png\" alt=\"cpcre\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":null,"date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Patient_FAQs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Resources/"},"frontmatter":{"title":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Intro_Disclaimer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":null}}}}}
