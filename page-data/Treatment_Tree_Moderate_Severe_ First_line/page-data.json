Because neuropathic pain responds only partially to opioids, the use of co-analgesic or adjuvant drugs may be necessary.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/banner-long-footer-whitetext.png\" alt=\"cpcre\"> <img src=\"images/acrrm.png\" alt=\"cpcre\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":null,"date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Treatment_Tree_Moderate_Severe_ First_line/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Treatment_Tree_Moderate_Severe_Menu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Treatment_Tree_Mild_Moderate/"},"frontmatter":{"title":null}}}}}
