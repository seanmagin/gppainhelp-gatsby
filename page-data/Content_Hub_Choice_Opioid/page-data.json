The choice of opioid depends on a number of factors:</p>\n<p>Ability to swallow: oral route is preferred; if unable to swallow or compromised GI tract consider transdermal (e.g. fentanyl patch, buprenorphine patch) or parenteral route (most commonly subcutaneous).</p>\n<p>Impaired renal function: avoid morphine (can be used at lower doses, less frequently), caution with oxycodone or hydromorphone. Recommended opioids are fentanyl, buprenorphine or methadone.</p>\n<p>Impaired liver function: caution with oxycodone.</p>\n<p>Allergies/intolerance: rare, often reflect previous adverse event (e.g. nausea and vomiting following post-op opioids). If true allergy, rotate to opioid of different class (see classification).</p>\n<p>Constipation/ileus/bowel obstruction: slowing of bowel transit time is a common feature of all opioids. Lipophilic opioids (fentanyl, buprenorphine) may be less constipating. Consider combination preparation of oxycodone and naloxone (Targin©), or parenteral formulations.</p>\n<p>Age: morphine tends to be poorly tolerated in the elderly (probably as a reflection of impaired renal function). Buprenorphine patches (Norspan©) give a continuous infusion of low-dose opioid.</p>\n<p>Cognitive function: consider once daily formulations or tablets/capsules that can be delivered in Webster packs where cognitive function impaired.</p>\n<p>Compliance: consider transdermal preparations for improved compliance.</p>\n<p>Cost: not all opioids are subsidised by the PBS.</p>\n<p>Availability: some countries impose strict limitations on availability of opioids.</p>\n<p>Experience: use a limited number of opioids and become familiar with their use; patients with difficult pain should be referred to palliative care or pain specialists.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/banner-long-footer-whitetext.png\" alt=\"cpcre\"> <img src=\"images/acrrm.png\" alt=\"cpcre\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":null,"date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Content_Hub_Choice_Opioid/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Content_Hub_Difficult_Pain_Control/"},"frontmatter":{"title":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Content_Hub_Breakthrough/"},"frontmatter":{"title":null}}}}}
