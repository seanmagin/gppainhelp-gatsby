In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"../../uploads/salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"May 01, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Second Post!"}}}}}
